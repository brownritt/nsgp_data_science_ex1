# nsgp_data_science_ex1

Exercise for NSGP data science workshop. Provides a demonstration of linear regression in R, including loading 
data from a CSV file.

To use, first clone (or download) the repo into an appropriate place on your machine. Then open RStudio, and 
open the file `linear_regression.R` in the editor. You should change the Console working directory to match the 
location of the R script.

From there you should be able to run the entire file, or step through individual lines using `Cmd-Ret` or 
`Cntrl-Ret`.

The base code should fit a linear regression and display a table of results. The in-workshop exercise will be 
to fill in the parts of analysis that are missing, and consider ways to improve the analysis.
